# Content
It's the content for a Tech Company website, in two versions, Arabic and English. Formatted in JSON files so the developer of the website can use it directly.
This project I worked on for freelance work.

# How to use
You will find two files
##### Translation_ar.json -> Arabic version
##### Translation_en.json -> English version
Open Any of them and you'll find the content formatted in keys and their values
